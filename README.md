# stormworks

I mentioend something about the United States being a fascist country that violates all of its own laws
and abuses people, and then lies about it. And Geometa called me a racist and blocked me from posting
to their Steam community, and then a few days later, they blocked my uploads, so I can't share
my creations the normal way. I think I would tell them to go to hell, except at this point
everyone is a frothing lunatic, and if you boycotted everyone who was a racist hypocrite,
you would have to live on an island by yourself. So, I'm going to keep making Stormworks creations,
but instead of uploading them to Steam, I will archive them here.
